This project is aimed at getting an access to Twitter accounts through API and creating a json file. This json file in twitter2 is parsed in different ways. The user can interactively choose which directory to go to. Furthermore, the program is working both forward and backward. When you go foward you should enter the name of key every time from the text above which os printed. When the user goes backwards, he/she should enter".." every time to make one step back in their pathway.
